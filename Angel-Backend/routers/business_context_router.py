Analyze this conversation from a business questionnaire. The user is in {industry} industry, located in {location}.

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{conversation_text}

TASK 1 - EXTRACT BUSINESS NAME:
Look for the business name the user provided:
1. Direct answers to "What is your business name?"
2. Domain names (e.g., "timelyservices.com")
3. Branded names mentioned anywhere
4. Company names the user refers to

TASK 2 - IF NOT FOUND, GENERATE APPROPRIATE NAME:
If user said "Unsure", "I don't know", or never provided a name:
- Based on their industry ({industry}), location ({location}), and business description
- Generate a professional, appropriate business name suggestion
- Make it relevant to what they described their business does
- Use their location if appropriate (e.g., "Karachi Timely Services")

IMPORTANT:
- If you find an EXPLICIT business name (not "Unsure"), return it with confidence "high"
- If user said "Unsure" or "I don't know", GENERATE a name based on context with confidence "generated"
- Do NOT return generic terms like "my business", "the company"
- Do NOT return just industry name like "Timely services" - add location or make it more specific

Return as JSON:
{{
  "business_name": "Extracted Name" or "Generated Name Based on Context",
  "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "generated",
  "source": "extracted_from_answer" or "generated_from_context",
